iNoteboook is your note in cloud. 

Developed by MERN stack 

Mongodb - A database for our application.
Express - Node js web framework.
React - Front end development framework of js.
Node js - Javascript Web server.

A brief note on all this :

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database known for its flexibility, scalability, and document-oriented structure. It stores data in JSON-like documents, making it ideal for modern, data-intensive applications.

Express is a minimalist and flexible Node.js web application framework. It simplifies building robust and efficient web APIs and applications, with middleware support for enhanced functionality and routing.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Developed by Facebook, it enables the creation of dynamic, interactive, and reusable UI components, simplifying the development of modern web applications.

Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment. It allows developers to build scalable, non-blocking, and event-driven applications, making it ideal for building high-performance web servers and APIs.

Main library used in our application :

bycryptjs - The bcryptjs module in JavaScript is a library that provides a simple and secure way to hash passwords. It employs the bcrypt algorithm, adding a layer of security by salting and hashing user passwords, making it challenging for attackers to decipher them, enhancing application security and user data protection.Also against the rain table attacks.

cors - The cors module in JavaScript for Node.js is essential for controlling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It enables or restricts access to resources on a web server from different domains, enhancing security by configuring the HTTP response headers, thereby preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests and potential security vulnerabilities in web applications.

jsontoken - The jsonwebtoken module in JavaScript for Node.js facilitates secure authentication and authorization by creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It allows developers to generate tokens with embedded user data, ensuring secure transmission and verification of user identity, making it vital for modern web application authentication systems.

React-router-dom - The react-router-dom module in JavaScript is a crucial tool for implementing client-side routing in React applications. It enables navigation between different views or components, maintaining a single-page application feel. Developers can define routes, manage history, and create dynamic, responsive user interfaces with smooth transitions in their web applications.

How it works :

Firstly the user will be sent to home page of our application
User has to register first. His credentials will be stored in the mongodb cloud
Once After signup user is redirected to the login page
After Successful login he will be redirected to user's homepage 
Now he can Add his note, update or edit the added note and he can also remove the note.


Finally it is simple MERN application in the future it will be developed.
